## 📚 Usage

1. **Visit the landing page** and explore features and use cases.
2. **Click "Launch App"** to access the dashboard.
3. **Upload your template** (DOCX or PDF).
4. **Enter your data** in the provided text area.
5. **Generate your report** with a single click.
6. **Download or share** your professional document.

### 🔄 Detailed Workflow

1. **Template First:**
   - Users upload their template document (in DOCX or PDF format)
   - This template serves as the "blueprint" or "structure" for how the final document should look
   - It could be a report format, a letter template, or any other document structure they want to maintain

2. **Data Input:**
   - After the template is uploaded, users provide their data
   - This data will be the content that needs to be formatted according to the template
   - The data could be text, numbers, or any other information that needs to be incorporated into the document

3. **AI Generation:**
   - The AI then takes both the template and the data
   - It analyzes the template's structure and formatting
   - It intelligently places the user's data into the template while maintaining:
     - The exact same formatting
     - The same layout
     - The same styling
     - Any placeholders or sections from the original template

4. **Final Output:**
   - The result is a professional document that looks identical to the template
   - But now it's filled with the user's data
   - The document maintains all the professional formatting and structure of the original template

This approach is particularly useful for:
- Generating multiple reports with the same professional format
- Maintaining consistency across documents
- Saving time on formatting and layout
- Ensuring professional-looking output every time
